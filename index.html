In the fall of 2024 prof. Pino Rosolini will turn 70: on this occasion, we plan to hold a workshop in Genoa to honour him and his contribution to research, teaching and dissemination of mathematics.

We hope you can join us in Genoa to celebrate for a couple of days of math, logic, and good focaccia
