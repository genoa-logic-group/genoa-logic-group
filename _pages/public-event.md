Pino has always been involved and a driver of opportunities of diffusion of mathematics and logic amongst the general public. To celebrate this, we plan to hold an open event with two lecturers who have participated along with him in such a pursuit.

To engage the general public this event will be held in italian. 

The event will be coordinated by 
* Roberto Lucchetti (Politecnico di Milano) 
* Roberto Natalini (Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche)

This event will take place at **Teatro Instabile**, Via Cecchi 19r, Genova, Italy
