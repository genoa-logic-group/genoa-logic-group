We provide applications of the elementary quotient completion introduced with Pino Rosolini in [MR13] to build 

on one hand
1. a constructive and predicative fibred version of Hyland's Effective topos in [CMM24] based on [MM21]  and validating the Formal Church's thesis;

and on the other hand
2. a constructive and predicative fibred quasi-topos of assemblies that validates  Brouwer's continuity principles and only the instance of  the Formal Church's thesis on quasi-topos morphisms.

These predicative topos-like constructions stem from the categorical analysis of the Effective topos and of its subcategory of Assemblies in terms of completions in  [RR90, MPR19, MT21, MT23] and  employs the tripos-to-quasi-topos construction provided in [MPR23].  They will be applied to provide predicative consistency proofs for the two-level Minimalist Foundation [MS05,M09] with the above-mentioned principles of effectiveness and continuity.
