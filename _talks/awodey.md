The Hofmann-Streicher groupoid model of (intensional) MLTT can be regarded as an interpretation into a 2-topos in the sense of Weber, with a weak factorization system of fibrations interpreting the type families, and a classfier E —> U for small discrete fibrations, generalizing the subobject classifier of a 1-topos.  As a model of HoTT, this is essentially the 1-truncation of the simplicial model of Voevodsky.  It contains a univalent universe of “sets”, the 0-types, as well as a number of important HITs, including propositional and set truncations, set and groupoid quotients, and classifying spaces BG.

Recent work (by Awodey, Cavallo, Coquand, Sattler, and Riehl) has shown that a cubical presentation of this model is entirely constructive, and so it be carried out in Hyland’s Effective topos Eff.  In that setting, one even has a univalent subuniverse of “modest" sets closed under products of arbitrary size.   Such an impredicative, univalent universe was used by Awodey, Frey, and Speight to give impredicative encodings of some inducive types, including some higher inductive types.

An open question regarding the full cubical assembly model proposed by AFS (and studied by Uemura) was whether the 1-category of sets therein is equivalent to Eff.  Swan and Uemura have conjectured that a further localization is required to arrive at a realizability oo-topos with Eff as its 1-topos of sets.  As a step toward resolving this question, we here consider the 2-dimensional case of groupoid assemblies and show that the subcategory of discrete ones is indeed equivalent to the Effective topos.
