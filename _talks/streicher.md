We discuss some partial results on separating the notions of
"precohesive" and "stably precohesive" toposes over arbitrary bases.
For this purpose we first review a number of equivalent characterizations of
the property of being "molecular" aka "locally connected".
Though the question is inspired by "relative topos theory" we give at least one formulation
of the problem free from any mention of fibered concepts.

If time allows we discuss some notion of "measurable cardinal" for elementary toposes
as suggested by Lawvere and Menni.
