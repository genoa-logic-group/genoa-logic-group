Rosolini has been involved with the fundamental issue of conceptual completeness from the very beginning. Even before Makkai published his notion of ultracategory, Rosolini wrote a short paper making the key ideas available. And more recently following refinements of Lurie he has analysed approaches in terms of his ultracompletion 2-functor. In this talk I shall comment on old and neglected work of Kock and Mikkelsen on the foundations of non-standard analysis. Most likely it is a small part of the overall story but it does bear on questions about the exact completion which is another topic on which Rosolini has thought deeply.
