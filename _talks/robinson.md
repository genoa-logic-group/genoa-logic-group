This is a recent piece of work that links in very loosely with an early interest of Pino’s: partial maps and algebraic structures. It has been known for a long time that the semantics of the tensor in BI and hence Separation Logic is an instance of the Day monoidal product. In that case it constructs a monoidal product in pre sheaves out of a partial monoid on the indexing category. We show that this construction generalises to arbitrary partial algebraic structures on the indexing category and give the semantics of Hybrid Logic as an instance.

If there is time, I will discuss how this technology is also useful in Proof-Theoretic Semantics.
