In 1998 Manes introduced the notion of collection monad on the
category of sets as a suitable semantics for collection types.  The
canonical example of collection monad is the finite powerset monad.

In order to account for the algorithmic aspects the category of sets
should be replaced with other categories, whose arrows are maps
computable by "low complexity" algorithms.

We give a systematic way to construct such models, inspired by
realizability, which include categories whose arrows are "low
complexity" functions between countable sets.
